CS3307_DESC = '''Objected-Oriented Design and Analysis: Software development comprises many activities (e.g., technical, managerial, governance, customer
relations, market analysis, etc.) among which are those that take requirements as input, and yield, as
output, software code that is intended to satisfy the requirements. In this development process is a key
artefact, the design of the system, that embodies the various components of the system interacting with
each other so as to provide the desired solution. Prior to, or even during, designing the system is the
analysis of the environment in which the system is to operate, including discovering the system’s
requirements. Arguably, without these two sets of activities - analysis and design -- in the development
process, it would be di!cult to build large-scale, quality systems.
The most widely-used approach to system design and requirements analysis nowadays is the objectoriented approach. Here, the Uni"ed Modeling Language (UML) notation is used to capture the user
interaction with the system being built, and how the system will be structured, and how it will interact
within to provide the desired outcomes. Over the years, the software engineering community has
identi"ed many useful patterns of how system components are structured and how they interact with one
another. Thus, the developer can attempt to reuse these patterns as partial solutions in the design of new
systems, saving design time and costs and attaining higher quality. These design patterns can be
implemented using object-oriented (OO) programming languages such as Java and C++.
In this course, students will learn about object-oriented analysis and design, and will be introduced to the
programming language C++. They will subsequently carry out speci"c assignments, and a group project
where they are expected to design and implement a reasonably large-scale system in the language C++. Course Texts

CS3331_DESC = '''Foundations of Computer Science: We live during the computer revolution, which is changing fast everything around us.
While programming languages change fast, the basic underlying theory does not. This
course covers the basic concepts of the theory of computation. To study computation
thoroughly, we need models. Ideally, we would like simple models to solve our
problems. This is what the theory of computation is about: computational models and
their power, with an impressive array of applications. That includes finite state
machines, regular expressions, push-down automata, and context-free grammars. A
crucial aspect is studying the limits of computations, which involves investigating all
powerful models, such as Turing machines. Some problems are intractable, that is, it
takes ages to solve them, others are provably impossible to solve even on an infinitely
powerful computer. Computability theory sheds light on these issues of fundamental
importance to anyone attempting to understand what computers can do for us.

CS3340_DESC = '''Analysis of Algorithms: Algorithms are precisely stated, general problem solving methods suitable for computer
implementation. Data Structures are methods of organizing data involved in computation.
Algorithms and data structures are central objects of study in computer science. Once
appropriate algorithms and data structures are chosen, all that remains in most computer
programs is routine coding. Moreover, algorithms and data structures go hand in hand:
neither can be studied fruitfully without knowledge of the other.
The course studies techniques for designing and analyzing algorithms and data structures.
The course concentrates on the logical process that leads to the creation of the algorithm,
rather than the algorithm itself, and the techniques for evaluating the performance of algorithms. The central idea is that Computer Science is more than mere recipes; it is about
computational thinking.
Topics
The topics are drawn from the following lists:
,algorithm design basics: algorithm design with mathematical induction, asymptotic
notation, and solving recurrence relations.
,algorithm design techniques: divide and conquer, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, and backtracking.

field of Artificial Intelligence. In this course we give a brief introduction to two very active areas of
Artificial Intelligence: machine learning and deep learning with applications in computer vision. The
programming assignments will be done in Matlab/Python. During this course we will study both
algorithmic perspectives of artificial intelligence and their practical applications especially in computer
vision.

CS4457_DESC = '''Computer Networks II: Although this course is primarily designed for the senior year undergrad and graduate students who
have background in computer networks and operating systems (such as 3357A/B, 3305A/B) it also
welcomes interested students from other relevant disciplines such as electrical and computer
engineering, systems engineering, mathematics, statistics, and Combinatorics & Optimization. If the
students do not have background in the area of communication networks they are encouraged to
discuss their interest with the course instructor to evaluate their eligibility for this course. The Internet and other modern communications services provided by telco companies (e.g., Bell
Canada, Telus, Rogers) are part of today’s modern society. Today’s Telco industry serves as a
technological backbone for any digital services and smart infrastructure one could imagine e.g.,
content delivery, smart cities, e-health.
This course will first introduce the core technical functionalities within a Telco industry; and then
deep dive into a number of network performance and resource management topics. The list of these
topics may include Quality of Service (QoS), Quality of Experience (QoE), Network Function
Virtualization (NFV), Software Defined Networks (SDN), Network security, Internet traffic forecast,
Network capacity planning, Network cost modeling, and smart services that use the communication
2
networks infrastructure. The course will also introduce network simulation basics and provide a
brief training on how to perform empirical analysis for networks using networks simulator such as
Miniet (http://mininet.org/). While exploring the technical details of these individual domains the
course will also introduce some of the core research challenges in these fields. Students will gain real
life knowledge and experience through discussion, assignments, and various research projects. The
learning component for the Undergraduate students will be tested via a number of assignments and
a final exam. Graduate students will be mainly involved in exploring a real-world complex Telco
research topic and working on a full fledge research paper that addresses a specific research
problem. In addition, this course is expected to assist the graduate students (who yet to identify their
thesis topic) to find an interesting real-world research problem that could be a good fit for their
thesis.'''

CS4470_DESC = '''Software Maintenance and Configuration Management: At the core, software maintenance involves taking existing software artefacts, understanding them, and then modifying or extending the code and/or other work products associated with the software (such as requirements, design and test suites). Other aspects, such as migrating a system from one platform to another, reverse-engineering (i.e., extracting higher-level artefacts such as design from code), and inter-connecting existing systems for inter-operability, are also part of this field. It is estimated that 60-70% of the software development effort in industry is maintenance and evolution. In this course, students will get practical experience in this field, working in a team, and addressing real-world issues of third-party systems.

 

Software maintenance requires at least three kinds of knowledge:

 

-        Domain knowledge: knowledge about the area of application of the software (e.g. mobile applications, physics simulations, processing large amounts of data, computer music, healthcare, medical equipment, social, legal, improving software development, and more), the context in which the software system will be running (e.g., business, hospital, govt. department, etc.), the users of the system, and other.

-        Technology knowledge: knowledge about the various software tools, languages, packages and technologies used in the software (e.g. iOS, Android, PHP, Java, application-specific technologies, etc.).

-        Code knowledge: knowledge about the actual code, documentation, test cases and so on.

 

Students are anticipated to acquire all these three types of knowledge as appropriate for their projects.'''
