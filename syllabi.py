    'CS 1026': '''CS 1026 provides an introduction to the basic concepts of computer programming and program design.
It is intended for students who have interest in learning basic programming skills including those who
intend to study Computer Science. This course assumes no previous programming background,
although having some experience with programming is an asset.
Programming skills will be developed using the Python programming language. Course topics include:
data types, variables, expressions, program constructs, strings (text), functions, basic data structures
(lists, tuples, sets dictionaries), objects, object‐oriented design, classes, modularity, and problem‐solving
techniques. Programming examples and assignments are taken from a variety of disciplines.

    'CS 1027': 'A continuation for both Computer Science 1025A/B and Computer Science 1026A/B. We will study data organization and manipulation, object-oriented principles, abstract data types and their implementations in Java, lists, stacks, queues, trees, recursion, file and memory organization. Course Learning Outcomes,Program in an object-oriented language, namely Java,Create classes and use inheritance for creating sub-classes,Identify and implement arrays and linked data structures,Implement and use abstract data types, i.e. stacks, queues, lists, and trees,Debug code and use exceptions to handle bugs gracefully,Identify the different parts of memory during the execution of a Java program,Program algorithms from pseudo-code Lecture Topics,Object-Oriented Programming Principles,Inheritance and Polymorphism,Exceptions and Debugging,Collections and Generics,Linked Data Structures Stacks, Queues, and Lists Memory Management Recursion Trees,Sorting'
