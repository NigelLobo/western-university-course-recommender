    'CS 1026': '''CS 1026 provides an introduction to the basic concepts of computer programming and program design.
It is intended for students who have interest in learning basic programming skills including those who
intend to study Computer Science. This course assumes no previous programming background,
although having some experience with programming is an asset.
Programming skills will be developed using the Python programming language. Course topics include:
data types, variables, expressions, program constructs, strings (text), functions, basic data structures
(lists, tuples, sets dictionaries), objects, object‐oriented design, classes, modularity, and problem‐solving
techniques. Programming examples and assignments are taken from a variety of disciplines.
Lecture Topics:

,Variable Types
,Input/Output
,Conditionals
,Loops
,Functions
,Lists, Tuples, Sets, and Dictionaries
,Exception Handling
,Object-Oriented Programming and Inheritance

    'CS 1027': 'A continuation for both Computer Science 1025A/B and Computer Science 1026A/B. We will study data organization and manipulation, object-oriented principles, abstract data types and their implementations in Java, lists, stacks, queues, trees, recursion, file and memory organization. Course Learning Outcomes,Program in an object-oriented language, namely Java,Create classes and use inheritance for creating sub-classes,Identify and implement arrays and linked data structures,Implement and use abstract data types, i.e. stacks, queues, lists, and trees,Debug code and use exceptions to handle bugs gracefully,Identify the different parts of memory during the execution of a Java program,Program algorithms from pseudo-code Lecture Topics,Object-Oriented Programming Principles,Inheritance and Polymorphism,Exceptions and Debugging,Collections and Generics,Linked Data Structures Stacks, Queues, and Lists Memory Management Recursion Trees,Sorting',
    'CS 1032': '''Techniques used for determining technological needs of businesses; building and managing systems to
meet those needs; development roles of individuals and organizations; planning and management of
concepts, personnel and processes; related software tools (spreadsheets, databases).
This course satisfies the Information Technology requirement for a Certified Accountant, a Certified
General Accountant or a Certified Management Accountant accreditation. The content of the course
has been approved by The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Ontario, The Certified General
Accountants of Ontario and The Society of Management Accountants of Ontario. The materials used in
this course for the introduction to Microsoft applications software have been approved by Microsoft for
use in the preparation for the Microsoft Office Specialist Certification exams.''',
"CS 1033": '''This course is an introduction to multimedia concepts and explores the use of different types of media
components (text, images, sound, animation and video) to convey ideas and facilitate interaction delivered
through a web site. Topics include design considerations and media creation/editing tools for creating
websites, graphics, sound, animation and video files. This course has a theoretical component and a practical
component. Media components will be studied at a theoretical level, and students will have the opportunity to
practice their skills by using software to create graphics, animation, movies, and web sites.  There are no
prerequisites for this course however the student must have their own computer and be familiar with the
basic skills of computer use and file management. Student will have to purchase some software (under 50
dollars) in order to complete labs and assignments.
Learning Outcomes:
Upon completion of this course, a student will be able to:
Recognize the characteristics of good design.
Identify the ways that our world is translated into data that can be stored on a computer.
List and describe at least 3 compression strategies used by computer scientists.
Describe how the world wide web and the internet and search engines work.
List some of the critical people and dates in the history of multimedia.
Recognize the characteristics that affect the quality and realism of  animation and videos.
Using software, create and assemble the pieces (images, text, sound, animation and video) to build a
website.
